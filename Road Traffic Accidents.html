		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I made this page to highlight the unfair representation of autonomous vehicles in the media. If you have any thoughts or feedback, please leave them in the comments below. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Human road traffic deaths are based on <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/"> WHO figures from 2015.</a> A search on BBC News and Google News found one case where a semi self-driving car was implicated in a car crash, and this was a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/probing-teslas-deadly-crash-feds-say-yay-self-driving/">very controversial case</a> where the role of autonomous technology was disputed. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/uber-autonomous-car-involved-in-fatal-crash-in-arizona">A more recent case</a> involved a pedestrian, who was struck by an autonomous Uber vehicle in Arizona.
			<br>
			<!--
			<br>
			 I realise this is an unscientific response to an unscientific argument. After all, it's not a fair comparison since the vast majority of vehicles on the road are being driven by people. This page is more about raising awareness of how dangerous the act of driving is, and how urgently something needs to be done about it. 
			<br>
			<br>
			There's also the <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02267.x"> psychological principle of unfamiliar ideas seeming higher risk</a>, even when there is lack of evidence to back this up. -->
